Hello world! My name is Jacob and this is my first GitHub repository.
I have created this as I'm learning Git and GitHub for version control.

## Things I've learned so far:
- How to create a GitHub repository

## Things I will learn:
- Git commands
- How to clone and fork
- Git commands on VS Code
